# Postgres_User_Data_Editor
 A simple SQL/Postgres/JDBC/Java project to demonstrate familiarity.

Naturally, we could also utilize more complex algorithms and do more
substantial data processing. However, I think the included operations
demonstrate the core proficiency well enough. If there is anything you
would like me to demonstrate competency with, let me know!

If you would like to run the project on your local machine, please
set up a PostgreSQL database with settings as found in the file.
Alternatively, slightly edit the file with login details suitable
to your own database.

Thank you for stopping by!
